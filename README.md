📩 Email/SMS Spam Classifier
This project is a Machine Learning-based Spam Classifier that predicts whether a given message is spam or not. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and classification.

🚀 Features
✅ Classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam
✅ Preprocessing includes tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal
✅ Built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface
✅ Trained with TF-IDF Vectorizer and a Machine Learning Model

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Pandas, NumPy
Pickle (for model serialization)
